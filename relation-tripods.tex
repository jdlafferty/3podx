\msection{Relation to TRIPODS Project}

Brown's TRIPODS award, \emph{Foundations of Model Driven Discovery from Massive Data}, focuses on the interplay between the analysis of data arising from a coherent data generating model or mechanism and the refini of such models from tools in data analysis. The focus areas of Brown's TRIPODS activities include, causal inference, graphs and networks, and geometry and topology of data. Each of these areas fits thematically with the proposed project and its objectives.

The activities supported by the TRIPODS award include intensive visits, Seminars, and Summer or Winter Schools, each of which will naturally support the theme of the proposed project, as a ``research domain'' to which methods in each TRIPODS focus area can fruitfully be applied. The proposed activities involve visits between teams of researchers and their students at Yale and at Brown, naturally dovetailing with proposed activities in the TRIPODS project.
