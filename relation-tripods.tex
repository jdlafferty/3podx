\msection{Relation to TRIPODS Project} 

Brown's TRIPODS award, \emph{Foundations of Model Driven Discovery from Massive Data}, focuses on the interplay between the analysis of data arising from a coherent data generating model or mechanism and the refining of such models from tools in data analysis. The focus areas of Brown's TRIPODS activities include causal inference, graphs and networks, and geometry and topology of data. Each of these areas fits thematically with the proposed project and its objectives: Causal inference is directly involved in deriving neuronal causation of behaviors or actions, and its geometric and topological study figures directly in attempts to relate neural network topology to causal structure. Likewise, inferring the structure of graphs and networks from restricted samples is a central challenge in relating noisy fMRI or cellular imaging data to brain connectivity. Finally, methods from topological data analysis (TDA) have been applied fruitfully to cellular representations of space in the rodent hippocampus~\citep{Dabaghian:2012} and are beginning to be applied to understand the nature of neural representations from human fMRI~\citep{Saggar:2018}.

The activities supported by the TRIPODS award include intensive visits, seminars, and summer/winter schools, each of which will naturally support the theme of the proposed project, as a ``research domain'' to which methods in each TRIPODS focus area can be applied. The proposed activities involve visits between teams of researchers and their students at Yale and Brown, naturally dovetailing with these activities in the TRIPODS project. Finally, the TRIPODS institute at Brown is housed within its Data Science Initiative (DSI). This Initiative co-sponsors postdoctoral fellows with the TRIPODS institute, in addition to hiring new faculty in core departments of Applied Mathematics, Biostatistics, Computer Science, and Mathematics. The TRIPODS+X workshop at Brown will be housed within DSI, which will be co-located with the new Carney Institute for Brain Science at Brown. This proximity will provide natural linkages between TRIPODS faculty and postdocs and faculty in Brain Science at Brown, providing a rich atmosphere for TRIPODS and TRIPODS+X activities focused on connections between data science and neuroscience.
