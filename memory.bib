	abstract = {Modern stereological methods provide precise and reliable estimates of the number of neurons in specific regions of the brain. We decided to estimate the total number of neocortical neurons in the normal human brain and to analyze it with respect to the major macro- and microscopical structural components, to study the internal relationships of these components, and to quantitate the influence of important physiological variables on brain structure. The 94 brains reported represent a consecutive collection of brains from the general Danish population. The average numbers of neocortical neurons were 19 billion in female brains and 23 billion in male brains, a 16\% difference. In our study, which covered the age range from 20 years to 90 years, approximately 10\% of all neocortical neurons are lost over the life span in both sexes. Sex and age were the main determinants of the total number of neurons in the human neocortex, whereas body size, per se, had no influence on neuron number. Some of the data presented have been analyzed by using new mathematical designs. An equation predicting the total neocortical neuron number in any individual in which sex and age are known is provided. J. Comp. Neurol. 384:312-320, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Summary The distinction between the neurodegenerative changes that accompany normal ageing and those that characterise Alzheimer's disease is not clear. The resolution of this issue has important implications for the design of therapeutic and investigative strategies. To this end we have used modern stereological techniques to compare the regional pattern of neuronal cell loss in the hippocampus related to normal ageing to that associated with Alzheimer's disease. The loss related to normal ageing was evaluated from estimates of the total number of neurons in each of the major hippocampal subdivisions of 45 normal ageing subjects who ranged in age from 13 to 101 years. The Alzheimer's disease related losses were evaluated from similar data obtained from 7 cases of Alzheimer's disease and 14 age matched controls. Qualitative differences were observed in the regional patterns of neuronal loss related to normal ageing and Alzheimer's disease. The most distinctive Alzheimer's disease related neuron loss was seen in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. In the normal ageing group there was almost no neuron loss in this region (final neuron count in the CA1 region: 4·40 X 106 neurons for the Alzheimer's disease group vs 14·08 × 106 neurons in the normal ageing group). It is concluded that the neurodegenerative processes associated with normal ageing and with Alzheimer's disease are qualitatively different and that Alzheimer's disease is not accelerated by ageing but is a distinct pathological process.},
