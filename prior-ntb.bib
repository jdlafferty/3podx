	abstract = {Analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience have not always matched the richness of fMRI data. Early methods focused on estimating neural activity within individual voxels or regions, averaged over trials or blocks and modeled separately in each participant. This approach mostly neglected the distributed nature of neural representations over voxels, the continuous dynamics of neural activity during tasks, the statistical benefits of performing joint inference over multiple participants and the value of using predictive models to constrain analysis. Several recent exploratory and theory-driven methods have begun to pursue these opportunities. These methods highlight the importance of computational techniques in fMRI analysis, especially machine learning, algorithmic optimization and parallel computing. Adoption of these techniques is enabling a new generation of experiments and analyses that could transform our understanding of some of the most complex—and distinctly human—signals in the brain: acts of cognition such as thoughts, intentions and memories.},

	abstract = {Lapses of attention can have negative consequences, including accidents and lost productivity. Here we used closed-loop neurofeedback to improve sustained attention abilities and reduce the frequency of lapses. During a sustained attention task, the focus of attention was monitored in real time with multivariate pattern analysis of whole-brain neuroimaging data. When indicators of an attentional lapse were detected in the brain, we gave human participants feedback by making the task more difficult. Behavioral performance improved after one training session, relative to control participants who received feedback from other participants' brains. This improvement was largest when feedback carried information from a frontoparietal attention network. A neural consequence of training was that the basal ganglia and ventral temporal cortex came to represent attentional states more distinctively. These findings suggest that attentional failures do not reflect an upper limit on cognitive potential and that attention can be trained with appropriate feedback about neural signals.

	abstract = {Background
The analysis of brain imaging data often requires simplifying assumptions because exhaustive analyses are computationally intractable. Standard univariate and multivariate analyses of brain activity ignore interactions between regions and analyses of interactions (functional connectivity) reduce the computational challenge by using seed regions of interest or brain parcellations.
New method
To meet this challenge, we developed full correlation matrix analysis (FCMA), which leverages and optimizes algorithms from parallel computing and machine learning to efficiently analyze the pairwise correlations of all voxels in the brain during different cognitive tasks, with the goal of identifying task-related interactions in an unbiased manner.
Results
When applied to a localizer dataset on a small compute cluster, FCMA accelerated a naive, serial approach by four orders of magnitude, reducing running time from two years to one hour. In addition to this performance gain, FCMA emphasized different brain areas than existing methods. In particular, beyond replicating known category selectivity in visual cortex, FCMA also revealed a region of medial prefrontal cortex whose selectivity derived from differential patterns of functional connectivity across categories.
Comparison with existing method(s)
For benchmarking, we started with a naive approach and progressively built up to the complete FCMA procedure by adding optimized classifier algorithms, multi-threaded parallelism, and multi-node parallelism. To evaluate what can be learned with FCMA, we compared it against multivariate pattern analysis of activity and seed-based analysis of functional connectivity.
Conclusions
FCMA demonstrates how advances in computer science can alleviate computational bottlenecks in neuroscience. We have released a software toolbox to help others evaluate FCMA.},
