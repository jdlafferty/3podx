\textbf{Jeffrey Brock} is currently PI under NSF TRIPODS grant CCF-1740741, ''Foundations of Model Driven Discovery from Massive Data,'' from Sept 1, 2017 to Aug 31, 2020. The Co-PIs of the grant are Stuart Geman, Eli Upfal, Bjorn Sandstede, and Joseph Hogan (Brown University). The total award amount is \$1,482,177. The TRIPODS grant, in year 1, sought to bring researchers from diverse communities together for workshop activities and intensive research visits. DSI and TRIPODS recently hired 3 shared postdoctoral fellows to start July 1. 
\textbf{Intellectual Merit} A fall 2017 workshop entitled Geometry and Topology of Data took place at ICERM in December 2017, bridging communities working in topological data analysis, and methods of diffusion geometry. Connections made there have generated three of the TRIPODS+X proposals associated with Brown's TRIPODS grant, in neuroscience, in data science education, and in gene regulatory networks.
The TRIPODS institute sponsored visits from researchers in topological data analysis to the TRIPODS-sponsored Applied Topology Seminar. Highlights include visits from: J. Curry, A. Gyulassy, L. Ziegelmeier, C. Curto, S. Oudot, A. Monod, and A. Blumberg.
The visit from Oudot served to further collaboration with E. Solomon, Brock's graduate student. Oudot spoke on their work \citep{Oudot:Solomon:persistence}, which uses techniques from applied topology to analyze intrinsic metric structures, which Solomon reprised at the Ohio State TRIPODS workshop in May. Sandstede's student M. McGuirl engaged with many visitors, including her Co-Advisor, Blumberg, and Ziegelmeier, with whom McGuirl discussed issues confronting women in a mathematics career track.
{\bf Education and Training Activities.} Brock and Sandstede have engaged in planning a summer bootcamp with Solomon, McGuirl, and Henry Adams of Colorado State, who will spend a week in early August presenting the framework of topological data analysis in the context of machine learning. This workshop (to run at ICERM) will focus on bringing graduate students up to speed with the tools and techniques of TDA, and bring in outside speakers to present their applications in machine learning.
{\bf Broader Impact.} The Geometry and Topology of Data workshop featured an open discussion over lunch to chart new directions for the field. The TRIPODS institute will in addition sponsor a workshop in mid-August on building community in theoretical foundations of data science, focused on regional collaboration and interaction between researchers in the theoretical aspects of data science.
