\textbf{Jeff Brock} is currently supported as PI under NSF TRIPODS grant CCF-1740741, ''Foundations of Model Driven Discovery from Massive Data,'' from September 1, 2017 to August 31, 2020. The co-PIs of the grant are Stuart Geman, Eli Upfal, Bjorn Sandstede, and Joseph Hogan (Brown University). The total award amount was \$1,482,177.

The TRIPODS grant, in its first year, sought to bring researchers from diverse communities together for workshop activities, and likewise engaged remote researchers to come to campus for seminar talks and research engagement with affiliated faculty and students. We have recently hired 3 postdoctoral fellows to start on July 1, who will assist with achieving the goals of the project.

\textbf{Intellectual Merit} A fall 2017 workshop entitled Geometry and Topology of Data took place at ICERM in December 2017, bridging communities working in Topological Data Analysis, and methods of Diffusion Geometry to study high dimensional data sets. New collaborations formed there have led to three  TRIPODS + X proposals associated with Brown's TRIPODS grant, in neuroscience, in data science education, and in gene regulatory networks. The new preprint \citep{Oudot:Solomon:persistence} of has recently appeared as a product.

Brown's TRIPODS Institute has been focused on developing models for center related activities that build on intensive visits from outside scientists working in the focus areas of the Institute. In particular, the TRIPODS Institute sponsored short visits from researchers in the theme of topological data analysis to the TRIPODS sponsored Applied Topology Seminar. Highlights include visits from, Justin Curry, Attila Gyulassy, Lori Ziegelmeier, Carina Curto, Steve Oudot, Anthea Monod and Andrew Blumberg.

The visit from Oudot, of INRIA, served further the collaboration with PI Brock's graduate student Isaac Solomon. Oudot spoke on their work at the workshop, and Solomon is speaking at the Ohio State TRIPODS workshop on their joint work in late May 2018. The general goal of our project is to use techniques from applied topology to analyze intrinsic metric structures, in particular metric graphs.

Sandstede's student Melissa McGuirl met with many of the TRIPODS visitors, who provided valuable research insights as well as career mentorship. In particular, she met with her co-Advisor, Blumberg, from U. Texas to discuss her thesis work. McGuirl also had substantial interactions with many of the speakers including Gyulassy, with whom she discussed ways to extract features from images, in particular using Morse theory. 

{\bf Education and Training Activities.}
The PI has engaged in planning a week long summer bootcamp with Solomon, McGuirl, and Henry Adams of Colorado State, who will spend a week in early August presenting the framework of topological data analysis in the context of machine learning. This weeklong workshop (to run at ICERM) will focus on bringing graduate students up to speed with the tools and techniques of TDA, and bring in outside speakers to present their applications in to machine learning.

{\bf Broader Impact.} The Geometry and Topology of Data workshop resulted in an important open discussion over lunch intended to chart new directions for the field. The TRIPODS Institute will in addtion sponsor a workshop in mid-August on building community in theoretical foundations of data science, focused on regional collaboration and interaction between researchers in the theoretical aspects of data science.
